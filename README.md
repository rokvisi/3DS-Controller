# 3DS-Controller
Sending keystrokes from the 3DS to a computer. (or else)

## How to use
1. Download the latest release of [`HandController.3dsx`](https://github.com/rokvisi/3DS-Controller/releases/tag/v0.1)

2. Create files and folders so you have the same directory structure on the SD Card of your 3DS.
```
ðŸ“‚ SD Card
â”£ ðŸ“‚ 3ds
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ HandController.3dsx
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ data
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ HandController
â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ controller.ini  
```
| File                 | Full Path                                       | 
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | 
| HandController.3dsx  | `SDCard\3ds\HandController.3dsx`.               |
| controller.ini       | `SDCard\3ds\data\HandController\controller.ini` |  

3. Add the `IP` of your computer and the `PORT` that it will be listening on to the `.ini` file.

Example contents of `controller.ini`:
```
192.168.8.104 8889
```
### Note
Keep in mind that if you use a local IP, your 3DS also has to be on the same network.\
On the other hand if you use a public IP, your 3DS has to be on a different network and the port needs to be forwarded correctly.

------------------

## Some path theory
Please note that in reality, the provided `.3dsx` file can be placed anywhere on the system.

To make it clearer for how it looks for the `controller.ini` file, here's a table that hopefully explains it:
| Started from the homebrew launcher| relative path           | Will look for                            |
| ----------------------------------| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| icon                              | `.3dsx` directory       | `data\HandController\controller.ini`     |
| 3dslink NetLoader                 | `root` directory        | `3DS\data\HandController\controller.ini` |

I am reluctant to use absolute paths, since I want to keep the behaviour of it using its `relative path\data\HandController\` to store data in case some users keep their homebrew apps in a different location. Using the `3dslink NetLoader` however forces me to.

## How to edit and compile source code yourself

1. Download Docker Desktop.
2. Pull the provided [docker image](https://github.com/users/rokvisi/packages/container/package/3ds-controller).\
The image includes a `devkitarm` development environment and a ready-to-use makefile with partial `C++20` support enabled.
3. Start the image as a container and attach `VSCode` to it. (Or use any other form of containerized development.)

If you want to be able to access any of the files from your local computer I advise you to create a volume for the container so that all file changes are reflected in your local filesystem.
You can find tutorials for all of this online if you get stuck.

## How to utilize
The provided partner program is [3DS-Controller-PC](https://github.com/rokvisi/3DS-Controller-PC).

### However

The 3DS application sends 12 bytes of data to a UDP Server everytime a button is pressed.\
The data is constructed as follows:
```c++
std::array<uint32_t, 3> get_key_states() {
    hidScanInput();
    return { hidKeysDown(), hidKeysHeld(), hidKeysUp() };
}
```
This means that it can be paired with anything that can recieve and interpret said data.\
Like your phone or a smart microwave.

This will be extended in the future to include touch screen and c-stick data.
